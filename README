A library/framework for building Android applications using Clojure.

WARNING: experimental and incomplete!


Dependencies
------------

This framework depends on the Android SDK and a fork of the Clojure
core which works around some incompatibilities of Dalvik.  You can find
it at:

  http://github.com/remvee/clojure/

The Android SDK is expected to be installed in a directory called
"sdk" next to the "clj-android" directory.  The Clojure fork should be
installed at the same location.  Don't forget to compile the Clojure
jar.


Examples
--------

You can find examples in the "examples" directory.  To build the
examples first run "ant" in the toplevel directory, start the Android
emulator and run "ant install" in one of the example directories.


Known issues
------------

Applications take long to startup because of the Clojure bootstrap
procedure.

Idiomatic Clojure code is slow.  The functional nature of Clojure
forces the DalvikVM to spend a lot of time on garbage collection.
